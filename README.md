I am having problem importing the Plotly library.

Grouped Bar Chart – How many bacterial infection requires lower MIC for penicillin than streptomycin and neomycin?

The visual encodings and perceptions that are represented in the grouped bar chart are the colors, length, position along the common scale, and area. We can observe that different colors are used to represent the different types of antibiotics per bacterial infection. Area can be perceived by looking at each bar. The length of the bar makes up the height and is aligned with the scale of the chart. 

The dataset is very skewed originally, so the scale on the y-axis has been converted to a logarithmic scale in order to better express the smaller data points. The lengths of the names are a long, so the labels on the x-axis has been rotate and sized down. The grouped bar chart is an appropriate visualization for this question because length and position along the common scale allow the viewers to perceive and compare the effectiveness of each antibiotics at a glance.

Heatmap – How effective is penicillin compared to streptomycin for treating Escherichia Coli?

The visual encoding and perception that are represented in the heatmap are color, shading, and numbers. We can observe a continuous color scale is used to express two polarities of minimum concentration of antibiotics prescribed for each bacterial infection. The shading of the color is complemented with numbers to convey the concentration.

The skewness of the dataset makes it such that the heatmap is not very effective in many ways. After transforming the data by taking the logarithmic of the MIC value, the lower values become much more meaningful in this display. However, the heatmap is effective at answering this question because the answers are made apparent due to the high color contrast.

Dot Chart – What is the most effective antibiotics in treating bacterial infection?

The visual encoding and perceptions that are represented in the dot chart are color, shape, position along the x-axis. We can observe that the different shapes complemented by their colors represents the different types of antibiotics. The position of each shape is aligned with the scale on the x-axis.

The dataset is very skewed originally, so the scale on the x-axis has been converted to a logarithmic scale in order to better express the smaller data points. The size of the bacterial name labels is much more legible by moving the labels to the y-axis.
